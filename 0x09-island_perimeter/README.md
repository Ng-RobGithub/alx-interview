# Island Perimeter

This project contains a Python implementation to solve the "Island Perimeter" problem.

## Project Overview

The task is to calculate the perimeter of an island in a grid. The grid is represented by a 2D list where:
- `0` represents water
- `1` represents land

Each cell in the grid is square with a side length of 1, and cells are connected horizontally or vertically (not diagonally).

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- All files should be executable.
- PEP 8 style guide should be followed.

## Usage

To use the script, ensure you have Python installed, and run the `0-main.py` file.

```bash
./0-main.py
