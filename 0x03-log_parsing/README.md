0x03-log_parsing

In the context of software development and system administration, log parsing refers to the process of extracting relevant information from log files generated by various applications, servers, or systems.
Here's a detailed explanation of log parsing:

1. Log Files:
Log files are plain text files generated by software applications, servers, operating systems, and other systems.
2. Log Formats:
Log files may follow different formats depending on the application or system generating them. Common log formats include Apache Common Log Format (CLF), JSON, CSV, XML, syslog, and custom formats specific to certain applications.
3. Parsing:
Parsing involves analyzing the content of log files to extract meaningful information. This process typically includes:
Reading log files line by line.
Breaking down each log entry into its constituent parts (e.g., timestamp, log level, message).
Applying pattern matching or regular expressions to identify and extract relevant data elements.
Structuring the extracted data into a format that can be easily analyzed or stored (e.g., JSON, CSV, database records).

Write a script that reads stdin line by line and computes metrics:

Input format: <IP Address> - [<date>] "GET /projects/260 HTTP/1.1" <status code> <file size> (if the format is not this one, the line must be skipped)
After every 10 lines and/or a keyboard interruption (CTRL + C), print these statistics from the beginning:
Total file size: File size: <total size>
where <total size> is the sum of all previous <file size> (see input format above)
Number of lines by status code:
possible status code: 200, 301, 400, 401, 403, 404, 405 and 500
if a status code doesn’t appear or is not an integer, don’t print anything for this status code
format: <status code>: <number>
status codes should be printed in ascending order
Warning: In this sample, you will have random value - it’s normal to not have the same output as this one.
